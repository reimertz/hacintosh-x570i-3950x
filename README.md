## Cost Efficiency

I  want to acknowledge that I am privileged to be able to spend this on a  build but it is very motivated since I work on this thing for 8 hours a  day.
It might not be obvious, but I  am saving a lot of money by investing in this. If you split this cost  over 5 years, it's $2 a day[0]. 

I rather pay that premium to have faster  Xcode builds, faster git cloning, faster render times, faster exports  etc while also buying parts thate are future-proofed.

Actually,  let's say I'd save 10 minutes a day and had a salary of $25/hour, this computer would pay itself. [1]

[0]:
Cost of computer / # of days I work in 5 years = Cost/day
$2500 / (5 days * 50 weeks * 5 years) = $2/day

[1]:
Salary / min * mins saved / day *  nr of days in 5 years = $ saved
($25 / 60 min)  * 10 min * ( 5 dys * 50 weeks * 5 years) = $2604 saved
